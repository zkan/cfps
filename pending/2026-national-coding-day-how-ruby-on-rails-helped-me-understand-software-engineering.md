## Description

Ruby on Rails didn't just teach me how to build web apps - it helped me truly
understand software engineering. Its conventions and structure turn ideas like
clean code, clear boundaries, and testing into everyday practice.

In this talk, I'll share the key engineering lessons I learned from Rails - how
it shaped the way I design systems, write code, and work with teams. Even if
you don't use Rails, these lessons apply to modern software development.
